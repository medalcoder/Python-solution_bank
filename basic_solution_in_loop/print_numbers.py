# QUESTION(The problem)
# Write a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10

# STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
#   What are we trying to solve?
#   We want to print nunber 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 on the terminal

#   What are the input?
#   variable i

#   What are the output?
#   1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

#  STEP 2: BRAINSTORM POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
#   (What programming concept to use to solve the problem)

#   We could use a loop to print
#   We could use .join() function


# STEP 3: CHOOSE A SOLUTION TO IMPLEMENT
# We are using loop to solve the problem

#   STEP 4: TEST SOLUTION WITH ALGORITHM 
#   (Step by step approach to solution)

#Algorithm For 'for' loops
#   give a variable name i
#   use for loop for i
#   use range function to print 1 - 11
#   print i

#Algorithm For 'while' loops
#   get a variable named 'i'
#   give variable 'i' a value of 1
#   set a while condition for i <= 10
#   print 1
#   inrease 'i' by 1 till it reaches the while condition

#   STEP 6: TRANSLATE THE ALGORITHM'S PSEUDOCODE INTO A CODE OF THE REQUIRED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
#   (Write your code)

#For loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
# OR

#While Loop
#    i = 1
#    while i <= 10:
#        print(i)
#        i += 1
